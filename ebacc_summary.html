<h1>EBacc Entry and Achievement Summary</h1>
<h3>EBacc entry and achievement by Sex</h3>
<h3>EBacc entry and achievement by Sex</h3>
<p>The data shows the trends in EBacc entry and achievement for boys and girls over the academic years 2023/24 to 2018/19. The indicators of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code>: Percentage of pupils entering the EBacc</li>
<li><code>pt_ebacc_94</code>: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 4 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)</li>
<li><code>pt_ebacc_95</code>: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)</li>
<li><code>avg_ebaccaps</code>: Average EBacc APS score</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table shows the gaps in these indicators between boys and girls for each academic year:</p>

</table>
<p>Note: The gaps are calculated as the difference between the values for girls and boys.</p>
<p>The table shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between boys and girls have remained relatively stable over the years, with girls consistently outperforming boys. The gap in <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> has remained around 8-12 percentage points, while the gap in <code>avg_ebaccaps</code> has remained around 0.36-0.52 points.</p>
<p>Since <code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code> are not available for all years, they are not included in the table. However, for the years where they are available, the gaps between boys and girls are consistent with the trends observed in <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> and <code>avg_ebaccaps</code>.</p>
<p>Overall, the data suggests that while there have been some fluctuations in the gaps over the years, the overall trend is one of stability, with girls consistently outperforming boys in EBacc entry and achievement.</p>
<h3>EBacc entry and achievement by Ethnicity Major</h3>
<h3>EBacc entry and achievement by Ethnicity Major</h3>
<p>The data shows the percentage of pupils entering the EBacc and achieving certain grades, as well as the average EBacc APS score, for different ethnic groups over several academic years. The indicators of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code>: Percentage of pupils entering the EBacc</li>
<li><code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code>: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 4 or 5 or above in the EBacc (note: <code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code> are not available for all years)</li>
<li><code>avg_ebaccaps</code>: Average EBacc APS score</li>

<p>The data shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between Asian and White pupils have remained relatively stable over the years, with Asian pupils consistently outperforming White pupils. The gap in <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> has ranged from 13.1 to 17.1 percentage points, while the gap in <code>avg_ebaccaps</code> has ranged from 0.57 to 0.88.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code> indicators are not available for all years, and therefore are not included in the summary tables. However, the available data suggests that the gaps in these indicators are also significant, with Asian pupils generally outperforming other ethnic groups.</p>

<p>The table shows the percentage of pupils entering the EBacc (<code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code>) and the average EBacc APS score (<code>avg_ebaccaps</code>) for different ethnic minority groups, as well as the gap to the White British group. The gaps are calculated as the difference between the value for each ethnic minority group and the value for the White British group.</p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indian and Chinese pupils consistently have higher EBacc entry and achievement rates than White British pupils, with gaps ranging from 20-30 percentage points.</li>
<li>Pakistani and Black African pupils have lower EBacc entry and achievement rates than White British pupils, with gaps ranging from 5-15 percentage points.</li>
<li>The gaps between ethnic minority groups and White British pupils have remained relatively stable over time, with some fluctuations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code> indicators are not available for all years, so the analysis is focused on the <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> and <code>avg_ebaccaps</code> indicators.</p>

<p>The gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between admission types have remained relatively consistent over time. The largest gaps are between selective schools and non-selective schools in highly selective areas, with selective schools having a higher percentage of pupils entering and achieving the EBacc, as well as a higher average EBacc APS score. The gaps between selective schools and non-selective schools in other areas are also significant, but slightly smaller. The gaps between non-selective schools in other areas and non-selective schools in highly selective areas are the smallest, but still notable.</p>

<p>The gaps in <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> and <code>avg_ebaccaps</code> between pupils with no SEN provision and those with SEN State EHC provision are consistently around 40% and 3.3-3.5 points, respectively. The gaps between pupils with no SEN provision and those with SEN Supp provision are consistently around 25-27% and 1.6-1.8 points, respectively. These gaps have remained relatively stable over time, indicating a persistent disparity in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with different SEN provisions.</p>

<p>Note: The <code>Gap to No Primary Need</code> column shows the difference in <code>pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee</code> and <code>avg_ebaccaps</code> between each SEN primary need and the <code>No primary need</code> group.</p>
<p>The data shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between different SEN primary needs have remained relatively consistent over time. Pupils with <code>Autistic Spectrum Disorder</code>, <code>Hearing Impairment</code>, and <code>Moderate Learning Difficulty</code> tend to have lower percentages of EBacc entry and achievement, and lower average EBacc APS scores, compared to pupils with <code>No primary need</code>.

<p>The data shows that there are significant gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with different first languages. Pupils with a first language other than English tend to have higher percentages of EBacc entry and achievement, as well as higher average EBacc APS scores, compared to pupils with English as their first language. Pupils with unclassified EAL tend to have lower percentages of EBacc entry and achievement, as well as lower average EBacc APS scores, compared to pupils with English as their first language.</p>
<p>The gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with different first languages have remained relatively stable over time, with some fluctuations. The gap in EBacc entry between pupils with a first language other than English and those with English as their first language has remained around 12-14 percentage points. The gap in average EBacc APS score between pupils with a first language other than English and those with English as their first language has remained around 0.2-0.5 points.</p>
<p>The gap in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with unclassified EAL and those with English as their first language has been more variable, with a larger gap in 201920 and smaller gaps in other years. The gap in average EBacc APS score between pupils with unclassified EAL and those with English as their first language has remained around -1 to -2 points.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the data for <code>pt_ebacc_94</code> and <code>pt_ebacc_95</code> is not available for all years, which limits the analysis of these indicators.</p>

<p>The data shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between different religious denominations have remained relatively consistent over time. The Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh denominations tend to have higher percentages of pupils entering the EBacc and achieving higher grades, while the No religious character and Church of England denominations tend to have lower percentages. The Roman Catholic and Other Christian faith denominations tend to fall in between.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the data for the Hindu denomination is not available for the 201920 time period, and the data for the pt_ebacc_94 and pt_ebacc_95 indicators is not available for any time period. </p>
<p>To better understand the gaps, we can calculate the difference in percentages between the highest and lowest performing denominations for each indicator. </p>
