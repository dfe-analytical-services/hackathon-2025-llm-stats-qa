### EBacc entry and achievement by Sex
### EBacc entry and achievement by Sex

The data shows the trends in EBacc entry and achievement for boys and girls over the academic years 2023/24 to 2018/19. The indicators of interest are:

* `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee`: Percentage of pupils entering the EBacc
* `pt_ebacc_94`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 4 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)
* `pt_ebacc_95`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)
* `avg_ebaccaps`: Average EBacc APS score

The following table shows the gaps in these indicators between boys and girls for each academic year:

| Time Period | pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee Gap | avg_ebaccaps Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 202324 | 8.0 | 0.36 |
| 202223 | 8.9 | 0.38 |
| 202122 | 9.9 | 0.44 |
| 202021 | 10.6 | 0.52 |
| 201920 | 11.6 | 0.52 |
| 201819 | 11.6 | 0.48 |

Note: The gaps are calculated as the difference between the values for girls and boys.

The table shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between boys and girls have remained relatively stable over the years, with girls consistently outperforming boys. The gap in `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` has remained around 8-12 percentage points, while the gap in `avg_ebaccaps` has remained around 0.36-0.52 points.

Since `pt_ebacc_94` and `pt_ebacc_95` are not available for all years, they are not included in the table. However, for the years where they are available, the gaps between boys and girls are consistent with the trends observed in `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` and `avg_ebaccaps`.

Overall, the data suggests that while there have been some fluctuations in the gaps over the years, the overall trend is one of stability, with girls consistently outperforming boys in EBacc entry and achievement.

The gap in EBacc entry (`pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee`) and achievement (`avg_ebaccaps`) between pupils with and without SEN has remained relatively consistent over the years, with pupils without SEN consistently outperforming those with SEN. The gap in `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` has ranged from 28.9 to 31.0 percentage points, while the gap in `avg_ebaccaps` has ranged from 2.09 to 2.27 points. 

Note: The `pt_ebacc_94` and `pt_ebacc_95` indicators are not included in the tables as they are not available for all years. However, the available data suggests similar trends in gaps between pupils with and without SEN for these indicators.


### EBacc entry and achievement by Disadvantage
### EBacc entry and achievement by Disadvantage

The data shows a persistent gap in EBacc entry and achievement between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils. The indicators of interest are:

* `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee`: Percentage of pupils entering the EBacc
* `pt_ebacc_94`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 4 or above in the EBacc (not available in the data)
* `pt_ebacc_95`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in the EBacc (not available in the data)
* `avg_ebaccaps`: Average EBacc APS score

Since `pt_ebacc_94` and `pt_ebacc_95` are not available in the data, we will focus on `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` and `avg_ebaccaps`.

The following table shows the values for `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` and `avg_ebaccaps` for disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils over time:

| Time Period | Disadvantage | pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee | avg_ebaccaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 202324 | Disadvantaged | 28.6 | 2.99 |
| 202324 | Non-disadvantaged | 44.7 | 4.46 |
| 202223 | Disadvantaged | 27.7 | 2.97 |
| 202223 | Non-disadvantaged | 43.4 | 4.44 |
| 202122 | Disadvantaged | 26.9 | 3.19 |
| 202122 | Non-disadvantaged | 43.0 | 4.66 |
| 202021 | Disadvantaged | 27.0 | 3.40 |
| 202021 | Non-disadvantaged | 42.9 | 4.82 |
| 201920 | Disadvantaged | 27.8 | 3.39 |
| 201920 | Non-disadvantaged | 44.0 | 4.73 |
| 201819 | Disadvantaged | 27.5 | 3.08 |
| 201819 | Non-disadvantaged | 44.5 | 4.43 |

The following table shows the gaps between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils:

| Time Period | pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee Gap | avg_ebaccaps Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 202324 | 16.1 | 1.47 |
| 202223 | 15.7 | 1.47 |
| 202122 | 16.1 | 1.47 |
| 202021 | 15.9 | 1.42 |
| 201920 | 16.2 | 1.34 |
| 201819 | 17.0 | 1.35 |

The gaps in `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` and `avg_ebaccaps` between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils have remained relatively stable over time, with a gap of around 15-17 percentage points in `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee` and 1.3-1.5 points in `avg_ebaccaps`. This suggests that disadvantaged pupils are less likely to enter the EBacc and achieve lower average EBacc APS scores compared to non-disadvantaged pupils.


### EBacc entry and achievement by Free School Meals
### EBacc entry and achievement by Free School Meals

The data shows a persistent gap in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) and those not eligible (FSM all other). The indicators of interest are:

* `pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee`: Percentage of pupils entering the EBacc
* `pt_ebacc_94`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 4 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)
* `pt_ebacc_95`: Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in the EBacc (not available for all years)
* `avg_ebaccaps`: Average EBacc APS score

The following table shows the gaps in these indicators between FSM and FSM all other pupils for each academic year:

| Time Period | pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee Gap | avg_ebaccaps Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 202324 | 15.6 | 1.43 |
| 202223 | 15.0 | 1.43 |
| 202122 | 15.9 | 1.44 |
| 202021 | 16.0 | 1.42 |
| 201920 | 16.7 | 1.36 |
| 201819 | 17.3 | 1.35 |

The gaps are calculated as the difference between the values for FSM all other pupils and FSM pupils. A positive gap indicates that FSM all other pupils performed better than FSM pupils.

The table shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement have remained relatively stable over time, with FSM all other pupils consistently outperforming FSM pupils. The gap in EBacc entry (`pt_ebacc_e_ptq_ee`) has narrowed slightly over time, from 17.3 percentage points in 201819 to 15.6 percentage points in 202324. The gap in average EBacc APS score (`avg_ebaccaps`) has also remained relatively stable, ranging from 1.35 to 1.44 points over the six-year period.

Note that the `pt_ebacc_94` and `pt_ebacc_95` indicators are not available for all years, so they are not included in the table. However, the available data suggests that the gaps in these indicators are also persistent, with FSM all other pupils outperforming FSM pupils.


### EBacc entry and achievement by First Language
### EBacc entry and achievement by First Language

The data shows the percentage of pupils entering the EBacc, achieving grades 4 or 5 in the EBacc, and the average EBacc APS score, broken down by first language. The indicators of interest are:

| 201819 | 11.2 | -15.3 | 0.23 | -1.35 |

The data shows that there are significant gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with different first languages. Pupils with a first language other than English tend to have higher percentages of EBacc entry and achievement, as well as higher average EBacc APS scores, compared to pupils with English as their first language. Pupils with unclassified EAL tend to have lower percentages of EBacc entry and achievement, as well as lower average EBacc APS scores, compared to pupils with English as their first language.

The gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with different first languages have remained relatively stable over time, with some fluctuations. The gap in EBacc entry between pupils with a first language other than English and those with English as their first language has remained around 12-14 percentage points. The gap in average EBacc APS score between pupils with a first language other than English and those with English as their first language has remained around 0.2-0.5 points.

The gap in EBacc entry and achievement between pupils with unclassified EAL and those with English as their first language has been more variable, with a larger gap in 201920 and smaller gaps in other years. The gap in average EBacc APS score between pupils with unclassified EAL and those with English as their first language has remained around -1 to -2 points.

It's worth noting that the data for `pt_ebacc_94` and `pt_ebacc_95` is not available for all years, which limits the analysis of these indicators.


### EBacc entry and achievement by Religious Denomination
### EBacc entry and achievement by Religious Denomination

The data shows the percentage of pupils entering the EBacc, achieving grades 4 or 5, and the average EBacc APS score, broken down by religious denomination. The table below summarizes the gaps in these indicators between the unique values in the religious_denomination column.

The data shows that the gaps in EBacc entry and achievement between different religious denominations have remained relatively consistent over time. The Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh denominations tend to have higher percentages of pupils entering the EBacc and achieving higher grades, while the No religious character and Church of England denominations tend to have lower percentages. The Roman Catholic and Other Christian faith denominations tend to fall in between.

It's worth noting that the data for the Hindu denomination is not available for the 201920 time period, and the data for the pt_ebacc_94 and pt_ebacc_95 indicators is not available for any time period. 

To better understand the gaps, we can calculate the difference in percentages between the highest and lowest performing denominations for each indicator.
