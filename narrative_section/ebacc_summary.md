The data shows that there are significant differences in the percentage of pupils entering the EBacc and average EBacc APS scores across different SEN primary needs. Pupils with no primary need have the highest percentage of EBacc entry and average EBacc APS score, while pupils with profound and multiple learning difficulties have the lowest. The gaps in EBacc entry and average EBacc APS scores between pupils with no primary need and those with other SEN primary needs are significant, ranging from 15.6 to 45 percentage points for EBacc entry and 1.04 to 4.60 points for average EBacc APS score. These gaps highlight the disparities in educational outcomes for pupils with different SEN primary needs.
